### Forecasting Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Using Time Series Models

This project applies various time series forecasting models including ARIMA, Holt-Winters, and Seasonal Naive to predict Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE). It includes:
- Data cleaning using `imputeTS` and `na_ma` with weighted moving averages
- Time series transformation and decomposition
- Rolling forecasts and accuracy evaluation
- Model selection based on RMSE, MAE, and residual analysis

🛠️ Tools Used: R, imputeTS, ggplot2, forecast

📈 Key Outcome: Holt-Winters model was found to provide the most accurate forecast for October 2024 PCE at ~19566.92

📊 Skills Demonstrated:
- Time series decomposition
- Forecast accuracy comparison
- Model evaluation
